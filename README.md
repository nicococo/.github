### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nico, a Freelance Software Engineer and ML PhD from Munich, Germany. My work focuses on **Machine Learning, AI, and their practical deployment**, with a strong background in data science, anomaly detection, and structured output prediction.

I'm passionate about building robust and scalable AI solutions. You'll find projects here covering:
* Machine Learning Toolboxes (e.g., [tilitools](https://github.com/nicococo/tilitools))
* Anomaly Detection (e.g., [LatentSVDD](https://github.com/nicococo/LatentSVDD), [ClusterSVDD](https://github.com/nicococo/ClusterSVDD))
* Scientific Applications (e.g., [scRNA](https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA), [niidbox](https://github.com/nicococo/niidbox))

Let's connect!
